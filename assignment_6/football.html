<p> football is a team sport with 11 players on each side.  It is played with an oval leather ball that weighs 14-15 ounces and is 11-11.5 inches long.  The playing field is grass or turf and measures 53 1/3 yards wide and 120 yards long.  It is marked by horizontal white lines spaced 5 yards apart from goal post to goal post, with the 50 yard line marking the center.  The goal posts are 100 yards apart, and there are 10 yard end zones beyond the goal posts at each end of the field.  The object of the game is to score by advancing the ball toward the opponent's end by running or passing it forward or laterally.
